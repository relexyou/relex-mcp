name: relex-ontology
description: Use when working a Relex case beyond a single question — auditing what the case "understands", finding gaps or contradictions in the case/firm ontology graph, steering the Relex case agent, or deciding what data to acquire next (RAG, statutes, case law, documents). Teaches the read → audit → repair → direct-acquisition → converge loop over the Relex MCP.

# The Ontology Collaboration Loop

The ontology is the case's **understanding**; the graph is only its data — and it
can be **wrong or incomplete**. Your job (as counsel, see `relex-counsel`) is to
audit that understanding, repair it, and direct the Relex harness to acquire what
is missing. The harness's next reasoning turn automatically reads what you fixed.

```
read → audit → repair/enrich → direct acquisition → agent re-reasons → re-read → converge
```

Everything below is PII-safe by construction: people appear only as
`[PARTY_NAME_n]` label tokens; fact entities carry keys, never values. The
server's PII gate rejects raw identifiers you might try to write — don't.

## 1 · Read

- `execute GET /ontology/case/{caseId}` — the case graph: real-world legal
  objects (parties, obligations, clauses, statutes, events, ISSUES) and the
  verbs binding them (`cites`, `concerns`, `supports`, `contradicts`,
  `undercuts`, `party_to`, `raises`, `established_by`).
- `execute GET /ontology/firm` (`?scope=org&id=` for an org) — the practice's
  abstract concept graph (doctrines, clause types, argument patterns). No case
  instances, no PII.
- Read the case itself too (`GET /cases?caseId={caseId}&full=true` — caseId is a
  query param; `full=true` is REQUIRED to get the timeline/phases, a plain
  `GET /cases` returns a bounded summary): timeline, phases, locked
  issues, drafts. The graph must MATCH the case data — mismatch is a finding.

## 2 · Audit — formal conflicts first, then the gap taxonomy

**The system audits with you.** Every ontology read carries `conflicts[]` —
formal integrity findings the platform derives fresh from the graph on every
read (never stored, so never stale): unresolved `contradicts`/`undercuts`
edges, claims resting on ALLEGED facts, ungrounded claims, deadlines without
date or trigger, obligations without obligor, open issues with no acquisition
plan, duplicates, low-confidence structure, entities flagged stale, and a
whole-graph staleness flag when case data changed after the last ontology
update. The digest view and your steering block (`steering.conflicts`) carry
the top findings; `?view=full` (or the plain GET) has the complete list with
`resolution` hints. The user sees the SAME list in the case UI.

Work them symbiotically: **resolve** each conflict via §3 ops (settle/contest
the issue, add the missing link/date/party, merge duplicates, re-verify and
clear a stale flag) — and **contribute** conflicts the formal checks cannot
see: when YOU spot a semantic contradiction, add the `contradicts`/`undercuts`
edge; when something presupposes outdated law, set `properties.stale=true` on
it. The moment you write it, the system formalizes your finding and shows it
to the user and the internal agent too. Never leave a conflict silently
unaddressed: resolve it, acquire what resolves it, or escalate both sides to
the human.

### The gap taxonomy

Walk the graph against the case facts. For each gap type there is one correct
acquisition verb — never fill a gap from model memory:

| Gap | Signal | Directive |
|---|---|---|
| **Grounding** | an issue/claim cites no statute, or cites one with no cached verbatim text | `POST /research/scrape` (see `relex-research`) |
| **Coverage** | a fact pattern with no enumerated candidate issue at all | steer a re-reason turn: `POST /agent {type:"case_req", …}` naming the un-covered pattern |
| **Entity** | an actor appears in the timeline/docs but not as a `[PARTY_NAME_n]` node | user finishes pending parties in the browser (deep link) or id-only attach |
| **Evidence** | a fact asserted with no source document | deep-link the user to upload; or search knowledge via the agent |
| **Conflict** | `contradicts`/`undercuts` edges nobody resolved | acquire the resolving authority, or escalate to the human with both sides |
| **Temporal** | timeline holes around dispositive events | ask the user ONE targeted question (question-brake, `relex-counsel`) |
| **Currency** | statute possibly amended / transposition pending | re-scrape the latest version before relying on it |

## 3 · Repair / enrich

`execute POST /ontology/case/{caseId}/agent` with a natural-language
instruction; the editor turns it into typed, transactional, PII-gated ops
(upsert, merge, link, retype, set issue status):

```
execute({ method: "POST", path: "/ontology/case/abc123/agent", body: { message:
  "Add issue 'limitation period' status=contested; link it as undercutting the
   payment claim; merge the duplicate 'Delivery Contract' entities; the
   [PARTY_NAME_2] node is the addressee institution — retype it authority." } })
```

Rules:
- Write only what case data or **verified** sources support — never model memory.
- ISSUES carry status `open | contested | settled`. Mark `settled` only when
  grounded (cached verbatim text or a user-confirmed fact) — say the ground in
  the instruction so it lands in the graph.
- After big case-state changes, `POST /ontology/case/{caseId}/reconcile` rebuilds
  the deterministic backbone (additive; your edits survive), then re-read.
- Curate reusable patterns (clause types, argument shapes — nothing
  case-specific) into the firm graph: `POST /ontology/firm/agent`.

## 4 · Direct acquisition

You discover; the harness fetches-and-caches (division of labour —
`relex-research` has the full doctrine):

- `GET /research/sources` — what the harness can fetch verbatim vs discovery-only.
- `POST /research/scrape {jurisdiction, code, article, authorityType, sourceHint?, caseId?}`
  — cache one authority's verbatim text. Poll `GET /research/scrape/{jobId}`.
- `POST /agent {type:"case_req", caseId, payload:{prompt}}` — steer the case
  agent: name the issues to (re)enumerate, the knowledge to search, the parties
  that matter. It reads the updated ontology automatically and emits its own
  scrape needs for anything still missing. These are steering-session turns on
  your private steering branch (`relex-steering` has the protocol); the reply's
  `steering.missing_data` maps directly onto the §2 gap taxonomy — treat each
  item as a gap with its acquisition verb (or its browser deep link).

## 5 · Converge — and say so

The loop is done when:
1. every locked/settled issue is **verbatim-grounded**,
2. every open issue has an **acquisition plan** (directive issued, question
   asked, or escalated),
3. no unresolved `contradicts`/`undercuts` edge remains without a human flag,
4. addressee and deadlines are locked in the case data.

Record the state as a short **Votum** (interim vote) on the case via a
`case_req` message — e.g. *"Ontology audit: 6 issues grounded, 1 contested
(limitation — directive pending job 4f2c), no open conflicts; addressee locked.
Next: re-reason after ingest."* Interim Vota land on the steering branch;
capture the convergence state in the session's **conclude summary**
(`relex-steering`) so it propagates to the main thread. Report progress to the
user with counts and labels only — never names.

## Anti-patterns

- Filling a graph gap from memory ("I know Art. 823 says…") — that's a
  **grounding gap**, not knowledge. Issue the directive.
- Re-doing the harness's work: you never scrape, never RAG-search private
  corpora yourself, never re-implement its reasoning directive.
- Overwriting agent-locked issues without evidence — repair with grounds, or
  contest with an `undercuts` edge and acquire.
- Big-bang rewrites of the graph. Small typed ops, then re-read.
