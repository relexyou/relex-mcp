# Positioning — Relex × any agent

**Relex doesn't replace your AI. It helps you use it end-to-end.**

Lawyers already use Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and other agents. What stops
them from using those models for *real* client work is the layer around the
model: confidential client data, firm know-how, client communication, payments,
and finding the next client. Relex is that layer.

Relex helps you use your agent end-to-end by:

- **Protecting PII and know-how.** Client names, national IDs, and contacts are
  sealed client-side under a PII password. The server stores only ciphertext.
  Document content is redacted client-side by default. The agent operates on
  structure and drafting and never receives plaintext PII.
- **Automating customer service.** Guest links, support agents, case agents.
- **Handling payments for free.** Billing stays in the browser; no card data in chat.
- **Opening a new market.** Be reachable through Relex.

The integration is PII-safe by construction: cryptographic sealing of parties,
redaction of documents, and an MCP `execute` guard that refuses plaintext PII
and returns deep links instead.
